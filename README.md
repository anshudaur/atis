# atis
I will be slowly adding and documenting the code. Please open an issue if you have any questions about the code or getting it to run.

If you want access to our data and code for preprocessing it, please email me (`suhr@cs.cornell.edu`). ATIS comprises LDC93S5, LDC94S19, and LDC95S26.

The main file is `run.py`.
