# atis
I will be slowly adding and documenting the code. Please open an issue if you have any questions about the code or getting it to run.

If you want access to the data, code for preprocessing it, and the database to execute the queries, please email me (`suhr@cs.cornell.edu`). ATIS comprises LDC93S5, LDC94S19, and LDC95S26.

The main file is `run.py`. You can rerun with my parameters by running `sh run.sh`. 

## Prerequisites
You need Crayon installed and running. See [this page](https://github.com/clab/dynet/tree/master/examples/tensorboard) for details. If you don't want to use Crayon, you can comment it out.
